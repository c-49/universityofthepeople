QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE:

• Which platform affects mental health most?
• What specific anxiety symptoms are linked to usage?
• Are there any positive mental health benefits?
• Does social media use affect academic performance?
• Do students realize the impact on their mental health?

POTENTIAL RESEARCH FOCUS:
→ Does increased daily social media usage correlate with higher anxiety levels?

VARIABLES TO CONSIDER:
- Daily usage hours (independent variable)
- Anxiety levels (dependent variable) 
- Type of platform used
- Student demographics (age, year in school)

Students who spend 3+ hours daily on social media will have higher anxiety scores than students who spend less than 1 hour daily.
