Topic Selection and Pre-writing Process
For this assignment, I chose to explore the topic of social media's impact on college student mental health. This topic interests me because it's relevant to our daily lives as students.
Pre-writing Strategy: Brainstorming and Question Lists
Following Hall and Wallace's (2018) pre-writing strategies from Chapter 4, Section 4.1, I used brainstorming and question listing to organize my initial thoughts:
Initial Brainstorm:

Social media use among college students
Mental health concerns (anxiety, depression, sleep issues)
Positive vs. negative effects
Time spent on platforms
Comparison with others online
FOMO (fear of missing out)

Key Questions Generated:

How many hours do students spend on social media daily?
Which platforms are most commonly used?
What specific mental health symptoms are linked to usage?
Are there any positive mental health benefits?
How does social media use affect academic performance?

(Note: I will attach a photo of my handwritten brainstorming notes as requested)
Applying the Scientific Method
Using the scientific method framework from Serdikoff (2021) and the University of Nevada resources, I can structure this topic for academic investigation:
Research Question
"Does increased daily social media usage correlate with higher levels of anxiety among college students?"
Hypothesis
"College students who spend more than 3 hours daily on social media platforms will report higher anxiety levels compared to students who spend less than 1 hour daily."
Investigation Steps

Literature Review: Research existing studies on social media and mental health
Data Collection: Survey college students about daily social media usage and use standardized anxiety measures
Analysis: Compare anxiety scores between high-usage and low-usage groups
Evaluation: Determine if the data supports or refutes the hypothesis

How the Scientific Method Enhances Writing
The scientific method helps refine my ideas by providing structure and focus (Serdikoff, 2021). Instead of just discussing social media generally, I now have a specific question to investigate. This approach transforms a broad topic into a manageable research problem with clear variables to examine.
The method also encourages evidence-based thinking rather than opinion-based writing, which strengthens academic arguments and makes papers more credible.
