Research Hypothesis and Credible Source Identification: Social Media Marketing Impact on Small Business Revenue
Research Topic and Hypothesis Development
For this assignment, I have chosen to research the impact of social media marketing on small business revenue growth. This topic is highly relevant in today's digital economy, where small businesses increasingly rely on social media platforms to reach customers and drive sales. The relationship between social media marketing efforts and business revenue presents numerous variables that can be measured and analyzed systematically.
Following the principles of developing strong hypotheses outlined by Serdikoff (2021), my research hypothesis is clear, testable, and based on observable relationships between variables. The hypothesis also aligns with SMART goal criteria by being specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (CFI Team, 2023).
Research Hypothesis: Small businesses that implement consistent social media marketing strategies across multiple platforms will experience a 15-25% increase in monthly revenue within six months compared to businesses that do not use social media marketing.
This hypothesis is testable because it establishes specific variables that can be measured: social media marketing implementation (independent variable), revenue changes (dependent variable), and a defined time frame (six months). The hypothesis also specifies measurable outcomes (15-25% revenue increase) and focuses on a particular business segment (small businesses), making it both achievable and relevant for practical research.
Identification and Evaluation of Credible Sources
Source 1: Journal of Business Research
The Journal of Business Research is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Elsevier, one of the world's leading academic publishers. This source is credible because it undergoes rigorous peer review, ensuring that published research meets high academic standards. Articles in this journal are written by researchers with advanced degrees and institutional affiliations, and they include detailed methodology sections that allow for replication and verification of results (George, 2024).
Source 2: Harvard Business Review Online
Harvard Business Review represents a highly reputable source for business research and analysis. Published by Harvard Business School, this source maintains credibility through its association with a prestigious academic institution and its editorial standards. Articles are written by business experts, academics, and industry leaders who provide evidence-based insights. The publication has a long-standing reputation for quality business content and is frequently cited in academic and professional contexts (George, 2024).
Source 3: Small Business Administration (SBA.gov)
The U.S. Small Business Administration website provides government-backed research and statistics on small business trends and marketing practices. This source is credible because it represents official government data collected through systematic research methods. Government sources typically maintain high standards for data accuracy and transparency, making them reliable for statistical information and policy-related research. The SBA specifically focuses on small business issues, ensuring relevance to the research topic.
Source 4: Pew Research Center
Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan research organization known for conducting high-quality surveys and data analysis on social and demographic trends. This source maintains credibility through its transparent methodology, large sample sizes, and consistent track record of accurate polling and research. Pew's research on social media usage and business trends provides valuable demographic and behavioral data that supports evidence-based conclusions. The organization's commitment to nonpartisan research enhances its reliability (George, 2024).
Source 5: Google Scholar Database
Google Scholar provides access to peer-reviewed academic articles from multiple reputable journals and conference proceedings. This database is credible because it indexes only scholarly literature that has undergone academic review processes. The platform allows researchers to access original research studies with detailed methodologies, citation counts, and author credentials. Using Google Scholar ensures access to current research from established academic sources while providing transparency about publication venues and citation impact.
Source Selection Rationale
These five sources provide a comprehensive foundation for literature review because they represent different types of credible information: peer-reviewed academic research, expert analysis from respected institutions, government data, independent research organization findings, and access to broader scholarly literature. This variety ensures that the research incorporates multiple perspectives while maintaining high standards for credibility and reliability. Each source contributes unique value to understanding the relationship between social media marketing and small business revenue through different research approaches and data types.
